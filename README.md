This code is wrote for evaluation of accuracy of degenerate (or multiple) PCR assays.
The users can enter sequences for (1) a degenerate PCR assay and (2) target genome sequences. 
(1) The sequences for degenerate PCR assays can be directly put into the code ("Input PCR sequences" section). Note that the sequences should be organized from '5 to 3'. Also, the sequences are expected to bind to positive strand.
(2) Target sequences can be added in a FASTA format ("Input genome sequences" section)
The number of matches will be calculated in "Result of In silico analysis" section.

There are two files (code and example sequences) uploaded in this repository.
